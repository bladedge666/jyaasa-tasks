### Binary Search:
Binary search is a searching algorithm which is used on a sorted array. It is of particular interest in computer science as it is the best way to search for an element in a sorted array and has the time complexity of `O(log n)` for the worst case scenario.

Let's think of binary search algorithm as a black box. Then the inputs will be a sorted array and a variable, say `x` denoting the element to be searched for. Then, the output can be either messages like "Found" (with index) or "Not Found" (upto the programmer to implement).

 The main idea in binary search is to first look for the middle-positioned value in the array. If that is the element we seek, we return. Else, if `x` is less than the mid-value, then we discard the right-half of the array and update the index positions for next iteration. If `x` is greater than the mid-value, we discard the left-half of the array. Then, we update the index positions. This process is repeated until `x` is found in the array or to the last iteration if `x` is not found in the array.
